# Papagayo-GD
A Papagayo version made by godot

My programming skills are poor, and my native language is not English, 
so there are a lot of pieces of code that can be optimized, you guys can update it and let me know.
(You can also call it an inferior Papagayo imitator v0.1)

Here are the tools i used:

v0.01
new phonemes (AH,SH,TH,SS)
If you don't want to enable them, you can just override "Map" with "MapOld"

v1.0
After almost a year, Papagayo-GD finally got its second update. 
This time the annotation function has been updated and the file (.json) format has been optimized, but 
this also causes the old version of the file to be incompatible with the new version
